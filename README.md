# Introduction to R Programming

Introduction to R Programming was co-taught virtually by [Akshay Surendra](https://akshaysurendra.github.io/) and [Anand M. Osuri](https://www.ncf-india.org/author/675623/anand-osuri-2) in Fall 2020 (September - November 2020) for Graduate students in Wildlife Biology and Conservation at the [National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) - India](https://www.ncbs.res.in/).

## Overview

 - The course opened with an introductory lecture that introduced students to object-oriented thinking and R programming nomenclature

 - Students were then provided four worksheets at a frequency of one worksheet per week. At the beginning of each week, students were sent a feedback form (Google Forms) to answer with any questions that they may have about the week's worksheet. These questions were collated and addressed by instructors in two two-hour interactive sessions each week

~60% of each session was spent addressing questions from students ("doubt-clearing"), and ~40% reserved for open discussions among/led-by students: students were encouraged to lead short discussions on new things they'd learnt in R that week. All questions were addressed by instructors at a conceptual level alone, and using examples different from those in the worksheet.

 - At the end of each week, students submitted answers to some questions (at the end of each worksheet) for evaluation;  answer keys were shared with students soon after

 - At the end of four weeks, instructors gave a capstone lecture of the course thus far and provided resources for going forward with R

## Grading

Students were evaluated based on the class/home work (60%) and the final exam (40%), where a higher weight for the final exam component was set by university rules.

Students' performance in each week was calculated on a score of 100: 20 points (for logic and workflow) + 25 points (for attempting all questions) + 25 points (for submitting the worksheet on time) +  10 points (for annotation) + 20 points (for replying to the feedback form)

These 100 points were scaled down to 15% of the overall grade.

## Teaching philosophy

This course follows a [flipped-classroom approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom), and attempts to teach students how to teach themselves R programming, rather than cram the course with content. We feel that such an approach works well when teaching programming to students whose primary interest is to use it as tool to achieve a goal, rather than an end in itself.

We tried to be mindful of each activity and evaluation schema and were clear about these students from the get go:
| **Motivation** | **Incentive** |
|------------|-----------|
| *logic over rote-learning* | points for logic = points for the right answer |
| *communicating/verbalizing one's work* | points for annotation; student-led sessions in class |
| *conscientiousness* | points for attempting all questions, submitting worksheets on time, being present in class etc. |
| *engagement* | points for submitting feedback |
| *working independently \& being comfortable with the unknown* | flipped-classroom approach, delinking learning goals from getting the right answer |

*tidyverse* versus *base-R*: We introduced students to several base-R approaches before transitioning to tidyverse. However, some concepts (particularly visualization and data wrangling) were only introduced through tidyverse.

## Positionality and student-intructor context

We (Anand \& Akshay) taught this module of *Introduction to R programming* to 17 students doing a Masters in Wildlife Biology and Conservation.

The program attracts students from a wide variety of academic training (journalists, psychologists, medical doctors, engineers and science graduates, to name a few), socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds (the program being fully funded), and of different ages (anyone below 35 years of age can apply). The challenge with such an introductory course is to bring everyone up to speed for later courses in statistics and computational ecology that assume a minimum level of profiency in R. Thus, this course is not motivated at speaking to the average student in class but to students who would find this course most challenging.

Both of us instructors are alumni of the program, and we have taught (Anand) or TA-ed (Akshay) this course before. This helps bring a bespoke wildlife/conservation lens examples and datasets used in this course, as well as understand unique challenges facing such a diverse classroom.
